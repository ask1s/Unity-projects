# Unity-projects
Here are all my games/projects on the Unity engine
## Retron
The idea is for a mobile/PC runner game where each ball has its own ability.
The priority is given mainly to the visual style, however, it was not made due to lack of time.    
Game scripts are in: `.\Retron\Assets\Scripts\`
## Tower layers 
The idea is a quest/puzzle game where you play in first person and figure out what you need to do to continue.  
To tell the truth, this game was created mainly for practice in 3D.   
Game scripts are in: `.\Tower layers\Assets\GameScript\`
